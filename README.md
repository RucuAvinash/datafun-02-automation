02-Project Initialization
Step 1. Add Your Module 1 utils file to your Project Folder
View your module 1 repo in GitHub (datafun-01-utils). Click on your Python file and download it into your project folder. (Or add a new empty file in VS Code and paste in the contents.) However you want to get a copy into this current project is fine. This is a useful change so be sure to make sure the Python still runs and do git add-commit-push. See pro-analytics-01Links to an external site. when you need reminders, or better yet, use the notes you put in your README file from Module 1 (it will be a good starting point for your P2 README). 

Step 2. Add a new Python File 
In VS Code, add a new Python file named yourname_project_setup.py. This is where we will do most of our work.



Or just start your own, as you like, and build it as you work through the example Python file provided. 

Step 3. Plan/Organize your Script with Comments
Use comments to plan the code in your new Python file. The organization is similar to the utils module we built in Module 1. If you start with the example, some of this may have been done. Adjust as you like - this is your project. 

Step 4. Implement Your Script
As you work through Chapter 3 and 4 and the skill drills, implement the suggested functions, using various repetition and branching logic. Use the provided main() method (or something similar) to call your functions by providing good arguments. Include the conditional execution logic at the end we learned in Project 1, so your main() function will only be called when you execute this new script directly. 

Important:

The goal is to practice a variety of Python features, so using specific techniques like list comprehensions are REQUIRED for certain functions.
Follow the instructions.
Use this project and these automation functions to master these key skills.
Use the skill drills/GUIDES and follow the provided examples.

After adding a new function, remember to make sure the Python still runs, and if so, git add-commit-push to GitHub. 

Step 5: Update Your README.md
Update your README.md to describe your project. Edit the README.md file and paste content from the example file. Do this at the end - or as you work on the project to keep your notes. As always, finish with git add-commit-push. 
Follow The Proven Path Provided
Hopefully, each step is not too bad and things go well. When they don't - that's to be expected. Part of the reason we get hired is to "figure things out" and we are here to help you do that. Learn to do a web search, and experiment with free AI assistants to help explain and provide any additional details needed. Remember, YOU are in charge. This is the process we support and these instructions work. Do NOT deviate unless you agree to invest time and energy to ensure any of the many alternate paths work for you throughout the program.

Explore
AFTER that is where the power and joy of working with Python begins. Keep good notes. Save the working versions and then, change things. For example:

Rename a variable.
Add a new statement.
Comment things out.
Rename a function.
View the logs. Log something new (e.g., every function when called and before returning a value).
Working with code is a fun, safe, rewarding way to learn. If you enjoy puzzles, getting value from Python is a great way to earn a living.

If you prefer listening while following the written steps above, optional Audio Guides are available. These are AI-generated two-person podcasts.

The audio is supplementary and not a replacement for the written instructions. The guides are not necessarily recommended. They may be distracting, and the speakers mispronounce key files and commands. They are mostly interesting from a state-of-the-art perspective.
